We present a robust deep learning framework for classifying dermoscopic images into seven diagnostic categories, including Melanoma and Basal Cell Carcinoma. Leveraging Transfer Learning, we fine-tune an EfficientNet-B3 architecture pre-trained on ImageNet. The model utilizes Compound Scaling to balance depth, width, and resolution, processing inputs at $300 \times 300$ pixels. To address significant class imbalance in the HAM10000 dataset, we implement a weighted categorical cross-entropy loss. Our approach prioritizes clinical Recall (Sensitivity) to minimize false negatives in malignant cases, achieving a competitive F1-score on the external validation set.
