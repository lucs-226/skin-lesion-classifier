\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Skin cancer is one of the most common malignancies globally. Early detection significantly improves survival rates, yet visual diagnosis remains challenging due to the high similarity between benign nevi and malignant lesions. Automated classification systems must prioritize sensitivity to ensure malignant cases are not overlooked.

\subsection{Objective}
The primary goal is to develop a classifier for 7 skin lesion types. Unlike standard benchmarks focusing on global accuracy, we optimize for weighted Recall, ensuring the model is clinically valid for identifying Melanoma and Carcinomas.

\subsection{Dataset}
We utilize the HAM10000 dataset for training, consisting of 10,015 images. Evaluating generalization capability is performed on the "Unified Dataset for Skin Cancer Classification" as an external test set.
