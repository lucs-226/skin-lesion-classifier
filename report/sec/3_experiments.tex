\section{Experiments and Results}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
The model was implemented in PyTorch and trained on a GPU-accelerated environment.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Optimization:} We utilized the **AdamW** optimizer with an initial learning rate of $3 \times 10^{-4}$ ($3e-4$) and weight decay of $1e-4$. This optimizer decouples weight decay from the gradient update, offering better generalization than standard Adam.
    \item \textbf{Scheduling:} A **Cosine Annealing** scheduler was employed to smoothly decrease the learning rate from the initial value to near-zero over the course of 15 epochs, helping the model settle into a flat local minimum.
    \item \textbf{Batch Size:} Training was conducted with a batch size of 32.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Test-Time Augmentation (TTA)}
To maximize inference reliability, we implement Test-Time Augmentation (TTA). For each test image, predictions are averaged across 3 views: the original image, a horizontal flip, and a vertical flip.
\begin{equation}
  \hat{y} = \frac{1}{3} \sum_{T \in \{Id, H_{flip}, V_{flip}\}} \text{softmax}(f(T(x)))
\end{equation}
This ensemble-in-time approach significantly reduces prediction variance and improves sensitivity on ambiguous lesions.

\subsection{Results}
The combination of Full Fine-Tuning and Focal Loss yielded superior results compared to baseline frozen-backbone attempts.
\textbf{Metrics:} The model achieved a competitive Recall on malignant classes (Melanoma, BCC) on the external validation set. The confusion matrix demonstrates that the Weighted Random Sampler effectively mitigated the bias towards the 'Nevus' class, resulting in a more balanced diagonal distribution. The use of Mixup prevented the model from memorizing the training noise, as evidenced by the stable gap between training and validation loss.

\section{Conclusion}
We successfully developed a dermoscopic classifier using EfficientNet-B3. By combining a \textbf{Full Fine-Tuning} strategy with robust imbalance handling (\textbf{Focal Loss} + \textbf{Weighted Sampling}) and advanced regularization (\textbf{Mixup}, \textbf{AdamW}), we achieved a clinically relevant model that prioritizes sensitivity for malignant skin lesions.
