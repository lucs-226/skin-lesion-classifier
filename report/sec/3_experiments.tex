\section{Experiments and Results}

\subsection{Training Configuration}
The model is trained for 20 epochs using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of $1e-4$. We employ `ReduceLROnPlateau` to adjust the learning rate if validation loss stagnates.

\subsection{Metrics}
We report the macro-averaged F1-score and Recall. Preliminary results on the validation set indicate a Recall of $0.85$ for Melanoma, demonstrating the effectiveness of the weighted loss strategy.

\section{Conclusion}
The EfficientNet-B3 architecture provides a robust baseline for dermoscopic classification. Future work will focus on Test-Time Augmentation (TTA) to further improve robustness on external data.
